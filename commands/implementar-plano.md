# Implementar plano

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself. Carefully follow the project guidelines @development.mdc (.cursor/rules/dev/development.mdc).

To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.
