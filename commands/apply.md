# Apply Adjustments

## Overview

Carefully analyze and apply the adjustments that were previously suggested, discussed, or agreed upon. The goal is to transform the discussion into code, fully respecting the project guidelines and ensuring fidelity to the request without exceeding the scope.

## Steps

1. **Context Analysis**
    - Review previous interaction for specific requirements and constraints.
    - Consult project guidelines (e.g., `.cursor/rules/dev/development.mdc`) for compliance.
2. **Implementation**
    - Apply code changes precisely.
    - Follow project style, architecture, and best practices.
    - Restrict changes to the requested scope (no over-engineering).
3. **Verification**
    - Compare final code against conversation points.
    - Confirm all items are addressed.
    - Verify no out-of-scope changes were introduced.
