# Action Plan

## Overview

Analyze requirements, documents, and codebase state to generate a structured, step-by-step execution plan.

## Steps

1. **Input Analysis**
    - Review provided documents, requirements, and context.
    - Identify key goals, technical constraints, and dependencies.
    - Map requirements against current codebase structure.
2. **Strategy Formulation**
    - Define technical approach and architectural changes.
    - Identify risks, edge cases, and performance considerations.
    - Select tools and patterns according to project guidelines.
3. **Plan Generation**
    - Break implementation into atomic, logical tasks.
    - Create a structured "To-do" list ordered by priority/dependency.

## Action Plan Output Format

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief objective statement.
2. **Technical Approach**: Key architectural decisions.
3. **Task Checklist**:
    - [ ] Task (context)
4. **Verification Plan**: Testing and manual validation steps.
