# Action Plan

## Overview

Analyze requirements, documents, and current codebase state to create a comprehensive, step-by-step action plan. This command transforms abstract goals into concrete, actionable tasks.

## Steps

1. **Input Analysis**
    - Review all provided documents, requirements, and conversation history.
    - Identify key goals, technical constraints, and dependencies.
    - Map requirements against the current codebase structure.
2. **Strategy Formulation**
    - Define the technical approach and architectural changes needed.
    - Identify potential risks, edge cases, and performance considerations.
    - Select appropriate tools, libraries, or patterns based on project guidelines.
3. **Plan Generation**
    - Break down the implementation into small, logical, and atomic tasks.
    - Create a structured list of "To-dos" (Checklist).
    - Order tasks by priority and logical dependency (e.g., Database -> Logic -> UI).

## Action Plan Output Format

1. **Executive Summary**: A brief paragraph on the objective.
2. **Technical Approach**: Key decisions and patterns to be used.
3. **Task Checklist**:
    - [ ] Task 1 (context)
    - [ ] Task 2 (context)
4. **Verification Plan**: How we will know it's working (Tests, manual checks).

## Action Plan Checklist

- [ ] Requirements fully analyzed and understood
- [ ] Technical strategy aligned with project rules
- [ ] Tasks are atomic and well-defined
- [ ] Dependencies and risks identified
- [ ] Verification steps included
