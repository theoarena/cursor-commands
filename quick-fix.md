# Fix Issue (Corrigir)

## Overview

Carefully analyze the reported issue to identify the root cause, then implement a simple and effective solution. Prioritize stability and adherence to project guidelines over complex refactors.

## Steps

1. **Deep Analysis**
    - Examine error logs, stack traces, and user reports to understand the failure.
    - Trace the execution flow to isolate the exact root cause of the bug.
    - Differentiate between the symptom and the actual problem.
2. **Solution Strategy**
    - Design the simplest, most effective fix (avoid over-engineering).
    - Verify that the proposed solution adheres to project guidelines (e.g., `.cursor/rules/dev/development.mdc`).
    - Ensure the fix addresses the core issue, not just the symptom.
3. **Implementation & Verification**
    - Apply the fix cleanly to the codebase.
    - Verify that the error is resolved.
    - Check for potential side effects or regressions in related features.
