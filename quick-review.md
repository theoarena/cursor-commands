2. **Cleanup**
    - Remove unused imports, variables, and dead code.
    - Eliminate accidental artifacts (logs, temp comments, AI slop).
    - Verify scope (ensure no unrequested additions).
3. **Sanity Check**
    - Verify changes address the requested task.
    - Check for obvious omissions or forgotten edge cases.
    - Ensure code simplicity.
