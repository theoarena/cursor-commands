# Apply Adjustments V2

## Overview

This command guides the AI to apply the adjustments that were previously suggested, discussed, or agreed upon. The goal is to transform the discussion into code, fully respecting the project guidelines and ensuring fidelity to the request without exceeding the scope.

## Steps

1. **Context Analysis**
    - Review in detail what was discussed and suggested in the previous interaction.
    - Identify specific requirements and mentioned constraints.
    - Consult project guidelines (e.g., `.cursor/rules/dev/development.mdc`) to ensure compliance.
2. **Applying Adjustments**
    - Implement the code changes carefully and precisely.
    - Follow the project's style standards, architecture, and best practices.
    - Focus strictly on what was requested, avoiding over-engineering or unrequested changes.
3. **Verification and Compliance**
    - Compare the final result with the points raised in the original conversation.
    - Confirm that all discussed items have been addressed.
    - Ensure that no out-of-scope changes were introduced.
