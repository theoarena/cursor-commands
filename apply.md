# Apply Adjustments

## Overview

Execute the suggested or discussed adjustments. Translate the conversation into code with strict adherence to project guidelines and scope.

## Steps

1. **Context Analysis**
    - Review previous interaction for specific requirements and constraints.
    - Consult project guidelines (e.g., `.cursor/rules/dev/development.mdc`) for compliance.
2. **Implementation**
    - Apply code changes precisely.
    - Follow project style, architecture, and best practices.
    - Restrict changes to the requested scope (no over-engineering).
3. **Verification**
    - Compare final code against conversation points.
    - Confirm all items are addressed.
    - Verify no out-of-scope changes were introduced.
