# Project Overview (Summary)

This rule is a table of contents. Use it to get a quick overview and know where to look for details; other rules and skills cover the specifics.

## Technology Stack

- Laravel, React, Inertia, Vite, Tailwind, Shadcn

## Required Skills

The following skills must always be consulted when working on this project:

- `laravel-react-inertia-dev` — global development rules
- `styling` — when dealing with CSS, SCSS, Tailwind
- `examples` — for code reference (frontend, backend)

## Project Documentation

- All comments and documentation must be written in English
- **`.cursor/memories`** — Persistent knowledge (business rules, architecture, exceptions, findings). Consult before investigating a problem area, when resuming work, or when implementing features that may have domain/architectural constraints; use `rg "^summary:" .cursor/memories/` to scan what’s available.

## Basic Workflow

When a Cursor **plan** has finished executing, consider calling the **review-refactor** subagent to review what was done. Base the decision on the scope of changes (backend and frontend):

- **Skip** the call if there were few or almost no code modifications.
- **Call review-refactor immediately** at the end of plan execution when there were:
  - Changes to logic
  - New components, tests, or modules
  - New or modified controllers, managers, hooks, or similar structural pieces
